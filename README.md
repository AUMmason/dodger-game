# Dodger 

A simple JavaScript game with Node.js Server for storing highscores at runtime. Created as a School-Project.

Dodger Classic was initially developed as a simple Browser Only game during 2017.

Regarding a school presentation in 2018 for the applied informatics subject, the dodger project was developed further, featuring a score and highscore tracker.

Several guests could play the game and get educated about the schools' informatics subject while doing so.

While skills for development of this game tremendously extends the knowledge gained from the named subjects teaching, it nonetheless was a nice experience to develop it in my free time and have other people give it a try during a school event. 

Also, a lot of things learned regarding Node.js!

Thanks to a good friend (MICK) for assisting me during the presentation!
